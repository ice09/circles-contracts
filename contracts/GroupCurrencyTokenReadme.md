# Group Currency Token Smart Contract

A group currency would define a number of individual Circles tokens directly or transitively (all accounts trusted by account X) as members. All of those members Circles could be used to mint the group currency.

_Note: The GroupCurrencyToken contract is WIP, non-tested, non-audited and not ready for Mainnet/production usage!_

See https://aboutcircles.com/t/suggestion-for-group-currencies/410 for further details.

## Tech Walk-Through

### Ganache

The initial drafts uses manual steps to setup, deploy and test the `GroupCurrencyToken` smart contract.

* Clone circles-contract-group-currency fork: `git clone git@github.com:ice09/circles-contracts.git`
* Switch to branch `hub-v1-comp`
* Open contracts in Remix-IDE at https://remix.ethereum.org/ with *remixd*: `remixd -s $(pwd) -u https://remix.ethereum.org`
* Start Ganache with mnemonic `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`
* Deploy `Hub.sol` with params `"1","1","CRC","Circles","50000000000000000000","1","1"` -> **0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3**
* Deploy `GroupCurrencyToken.sol` with params 
`"0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3","0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001", "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266", 1, "GCT", "GCT"` -> **0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512**
  * This will also call `organizationSignup` on Hub.
* Call `signup` on Hub contract with Ganache Account 1 `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8` (Alice Signup)
	* This will deploy an individual Circles-Token from the Hub contract with Token address **0xa16E02E87b7454126E5E10d957A927A7F5B5d2be**
* Load `Token.sol` at `0xa16E02E87b7454126E5E10d957A927A7F5B5d2be`
	* This is the Circles-Token which will be used as Collateral Token
* Transfer with Remix Account 1 "1000" Tokens to GCT Address `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`

#### mint

* [GroupCurrencyToken] `mint(0xa16E02E87b7454126E5E10d957A927A7F5B5d2be,1000)` with any Remix Account (**Note: unrestricted access! Anybody can mint!**)
